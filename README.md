XGBoost plot only works for the NBA Championship market, and for prediction markets that are both in Kalshi and Polymarket (since you are using the Kalshi data to predict movement for Polymarket price). Only predicts the yes price. Green background means up, red means down or can't predict. Use threshold to indicate risk (0.5 is most risky, 0 is least risky prediction).
